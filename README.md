<h1>Hi, I'm Sarah! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I am a software engineering student, previously I worked as a designer for years. This facilitated my curiosity to understand issues such as usability and accessibility, 
  I greatly appreciate and prioritize the user experience, I truly believe that studying people is not a waste of time but rather a future investment.</p>
